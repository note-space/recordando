## recordando
recordando is a small PHP program to edit a collection of notes, and to show those notes in the simplest way.
<br />
It shows an array of cards; any card can be set as a "portal" to lead to another array.
<br />
There are very few features here .. moving cards around, changing a card's color, searching for text .. it's a program for people who don't want anything more.

<br />
It does have one more feature .. a calculating function that works within a block of text.

<br />
It is designed to run as a PHP desktop application installed locally on any Windows, Macintosh or Linux personal computer or laptop. To use it on an Android device or on a Chromebook, you could run PHP with the Termux app.  On an iPhone or iPad, you could run PHP with the PHPWin app (free with ads) or Draftcode (a very small purchase).
<br />
There is a html page, "start_on_any_computer.htm", that displays the text of a command for you to copy & paste into a terminal window that you open for yourself.
<br />
Most people will consider that to be too much effort .. but, it does mean that there is not a hidden process running.
<br />
After that, you click on the "my recordando" link to see the results of the .php file.

You'll probably want to minimize the terminal window ..

<br />
The notes are saved in a sqlite file on the local computer; nothing is on the internet .. though you could place the program in some sort of file-sharing system.
<br />
<br />
The download includes a small PHP "engine" for use on Windows; Macintosh has PHP built in, and Linux users can install PHP from repository.
<br />
The PHP engine is just 3 files from the php-5.4.45-Win32-VC9-x86.zip file at windows.php.net/downloads/releases/archives .
<br />
(The 5.4 version was chosen because its Visual C runtime requirement is compatiable with older PCs).
<br />
<br />
The program is also offers a daily journal entry screen.

'recordando' in Spanish translates to 'remembering' in English
